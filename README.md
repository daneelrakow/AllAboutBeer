# AllAboutBeer
All About Beer - a project for my web programming class

## Summary

All About Beer is a website that uses the BreweryDB API to fetch a random beer and display its information to the user. The user is then able to add that beer to a list if they find it interesting, and then download it once they are done in a text file.

## Cool stuff I implemented:
* API Get Requests
* Async Javascript
* Downloading Text Files
* jQuery
* Git, obviously
* Responsive Design
